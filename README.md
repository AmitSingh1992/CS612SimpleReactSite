# CS612SimpleReactSite

This application is a simple single page, static website used to try out the concepts of React.js.

To run the website, simply download all the files and open the 'BlogSite.html' file in your web browser of choice.

The html file has three script source calls to online resources that allow the file to utilize react and jsx.

Be sure that all related files (stylesheet, images, etc.) are in the same directory as the html file 'BlogSite'.
